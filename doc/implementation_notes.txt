\section checksum_sec Checksum algorithm
Currently SHA512 used as hashing algorithm (Crypto++ library).
crc32 boost implementation or any of hashing algorithms
implemented in Crypto++ can easily be used instead.

\section build_sec Building engine
Implementation rely on cmake building engine. Currently it can't be easily replaced
(source code changes may be required). We need program execution abstraction engine
to encapsulate program executions in functors.

\section dfs_sec Depth-first search implementation
DFS is implemented in naive recursive manner with circular-dependencies checks
and without stack-overflow checks, so the depth of depends is limited by stack size.

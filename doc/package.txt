\page package_page Package
Package is a self-sufficient entity that can be used for specified purposes,
such as executing, shared data. Packages can be used on different
platforms, so package is being built on every client machine.
Building results are cached.

\section building_sec Building
\subsection entities_ssec Entities
Package is a building result.
We will distinguish the following entities:
	- <b>package installation</b> -- the result of merging <b>package build</b> and other <b>package installations</b> (specified by package maintainer)
		- note, that package is installed in temporary directory and then is being packed
		- <b>package installation</b> term will be used to name
	- <b>package build</b> -- the result of building <b>package sources</b>
	- <b>package source</b> -- the result of extraction of <b>package self sources</b> and <b>package imports</b> merged together in one directory
		- <b>package imports</b> -- union of <b>package source imports</b> and <b>package installation imports</b>
			- <b>package installation import</b> -- extraction of <b>package installation</b> of specified package into <b>package source</b> directory
			- <b>package source import</b> -- extraction of <b>package source</b> of specified package into <b>package source</b> directory
		- <b>package self source</b> -- sources that belong to corresponding package
	- <b>package checksum</b> -- checksum of all <b>package self sources</b> and <b>package index</b>
	- <b>package index</b> -- configuration file of the corresponding package
\subsection stages_ssec Stages
Package building process can be separated into different stages:
	- <b>package index</b> update -- we should synchronize with server to retrieve the latest data (<b>package checksum</b> is also updated at this stage)
		- note, that we have to update all package dependencies <b>package indices</b>
	- depth-first-search dependency build process
	- package building -- creation of the <b>package build</b>
		- <b>package source</b> extraction
			- <b>package self source</b> extraction
			- <b>package imports</b> extraction
		- configuration
		- compilation
		- packing
	- <b>package installation</b> creation
		- unpacking of <b>package build</b>
		- merging with specified <b>package installations</b>
		- packing into <b>package installation</b> entity

\section example_sec Example

Consider the following example: we have to build A <b>package installation</b>.
There are also B, C, D and E packages.

Note the following facts:
	- <b>package self source</b> can be a list of sources, but graph complexity is not influenced by that.
	- package can have arbitrary number of <b>package imports</b> of any kind specified above
	- <b>package self sources</b> are always leaves.
	- <b>package self source</b> and <b>package build</b> are inaccessible directly for import by other packages.
	- dependency graph is always topological-sortable, otherwise packages are ill-formed
	- <b>E installation</b> will not be built because nothing depends on it (building is lazy)
	- everything will be built in topological-sort order
	- <b>package self source</b>, <b>package build</b> and <b>package installation</b> will be cached

\section stages_sec Stages
Package building process can be separated into different stages:
	- <b>package index</b> update -- we should synchronize with server to retrieve the latest data (<b>package checksum</b> is also updated at this stage)
		- note, that we have to update all package dependencies <b>package indices</b>
	- depth-first-search dependency build process
	- package building -- creation of the <b>package build</b>
		- <b>package source</b> extraction
			- <b>package self source</b> extraction
			- <b>package imports</b> extraction
		- configuration
		- compilation
		- packing
	- <b>package installation</b> building
		- unpacking of <b>package build</b>
		- merging with specified <b>package installations</b>
		- packing into <b>package installation</b> entity

\section algo_sec Building algorithms
Please note that for platform-independent execution support we will move all file and directory names into \ref configuration_page "configuration" file.<br>
Instead of real names configuration aliases will be used, such as <b>name::file::build</b> value will be taken from \ref configuration_page "configuration" file.
\subsection package_building_ssec Package building
- create temporary <b>${build}</b> directory
- extract sources into <b>${build}/name::dir::source</b> directory accumulating checksums into <b>build_snapshot</b>
- save <b>build_snapshot</b> into <b>${build}/name::file::build_snapshot</b>
- configure sources to build in <b>${build}/name::dir::build</b>
- build sources in <b>${build}/name::dir::build</b> directory
- create <b>${build}/name::dir::installation</b> directory and install building results in it
- pack <b>${build}/name::dir::installation</b> directory into <b>${build}/name::file::build</b>
- copy <b>${build}/name::file::build</b> into <b>${package}/name::file::build</b>
- copy <b>${build}/name::file::build_snapshot</b> into <b>${package}/name::file::build_snapshot</b>

\subsection package_installation_ssec Package installation building
- create temporary <b>${build}</b> directory
- extract <b>${package}/name::file::build</b> into <b>${build}/name::dir::installation</b> directory
- merge it with other package installation
- merge <b>${build}/name::file::build_snapshot</b> with imported package installations snapshots into <b>${build}/name::file::installation_snapshot</b>
- pack it into <b>${build}/name::file::installation</b>
- copy <b>${build}/name::file::installation</b> into <b>${package}/name::file::installation</b>
- copy <b>${build}/name::file::installation_snapshot</b> into <b>${package}/name::file::installation_snapshot</b>

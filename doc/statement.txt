\section statement_introduction_sec Introduction

Statement contains problem definition. It is essential part of the problem.
Moreover, without it problem does not exists. For different languages
and formats support \ref statement_version_sec entity is introduced.
Statement consists of statement versions.

Statement version implementations are placed in bacs::problem::statement_versions.

\section statement_version_sec Statement version

Statement version is \ref buildable_page.
Each statement version is defined in configuration file.
Configuration file ends with ".ini" suffix and located in the root folder
of the statement directory.

Consider the following directory tree

\code{none}
/en_html.ini
/en_pdf.ini
/en.tex
/resources/
          schema.png
          graph.png
          file.ini
\endcode

In example above we can see three ini files: "en_html.ini", "en_pdf.ini" and "file.ini".
Only "en_html.ini" and "en_pdf.ini" define statement versions.

\section statement_configuration_file_sec Configuration file

Configuration file defines the following sections:

1. <b>[info]</b> defines the following options:

   a. *lang* defines statement version \ref statement_language_ssec

2. <b>[build]</b> section is described in particular builder specifications.

\see bacs::problem::statement_versions

\subsection statement_language_ssec Language

Statement version is written in a particular language.
Language should be defined by the string.

Empty string is a special value treated as "unknown".
In the future empty string should not be used and all
statement version should have language specified.

Other values are specified by *BACS.WEB* project.

\section introduction_sec Introduction

This library provides implementation of package management system, that
    - does not require installation of packages for using them
    - does not require any type of root access
    - does not require dynamic server part, static file access is enough (like static read-only http or ftp server)
    - implicitly can support encryption of data downloading and authentication/authorization mechanisms
    - does not download excess information (such as full list of packages or precalculated dependencies lists)
    - provides caching support
    - does not provide parallel package building (may be in the future), but implicitly provides parallel make
